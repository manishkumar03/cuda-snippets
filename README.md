# Overview
This repository will eventually contain a *complete* convolutional neural network written from scratch without using any of the standard CUDA libraries like cuBLAS or cuDNN etc. This exercise is for learning low-level CUDA programming and to really understand how CNNs work under the hood. The final CNN will be used to classify MNIST digits.
